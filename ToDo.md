# To Do

* Make the selection for runs more robust - currently just matches the form run_{i}
* Make it so that if a user inputs temperature values (e.g. 800, 900, 1000 etc) the code will find the corresponding directory even if it is called something slightly different (i.e. T800, 900K, T1000_Alpha etc)
* Print out something so the user knows its running - maybe an ASCII and a progress bar
