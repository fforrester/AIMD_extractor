# AIMD_extractor
Tool for extracting MSD, calculating activation energy, conductivities and diffusivities from VASP AIMD runs.

Note: This code is not robust and is only intended for use within the author's directory architecture. An example of this is given below:

temperature_1000/run_{i}/XDATCAR  # Output trajectory files at 1000 K
temperture_800/run_{j}/XDATCAR    # Output trajectory files at 1000 K

Variability in the number of runs per temperature is permitted i.e. where i â‰  j
